# lab_huffman

In this lab work, we are using the encoding and decoding skills for text file.<br>

### Huffman Encoding
Huffman encoding takes in a text input and generates a binary code (a string of 0’s and 1’s) that represents that text. <br>

For example, the sentence "feed me more food" will be encoded into the binary string and decoding using the huffman tree, with the tree, we can decode the original sentence<br>

Input: "feed me more food"<br>
Output (encoding): "10000000111111010011110111001000111100110110011"
