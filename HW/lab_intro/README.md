This is the first lab homework, the main focus is doing some filter on image <br>

Details: <br><br>

1. Understanding the HSL Color Space<br><br>

* Hue (denoted as h) defines the color itself, for example, red in distinction to blue or yellow. The values for the hue axis run from 0–360° beginning and ending with red and running through green, blue and all intermediary colors like greenish-blue, orange,purple, etc.<br>
* Saturation (denoted as s) indicates the degree to which the hue differs from a neutral gray. The values run from 0%, which is no color saturation, to 100%, which is the fullest saturation of a given hue at a given percentage of illumination.<br>
* Luminance (denoted as l) indicates the level of illumination. The values run as percentages; 0% appears black (no light) while 100% is full illumination, which washes out the color (it appears white).<br><br>

2. Grayscale<br><br>
Tuning every pixel's saturate into 0% <br><br>
